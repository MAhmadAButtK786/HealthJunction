Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF),PEF measures the maximum speed at which a person can exhale air. Normal values vary based on age and sex.
Visual Acuity,"A measure of how well a person can see, typically tested using an eye chart. Normal visual acuity is 20/20, which means you can see at 20 feet what a person with normal vision can see at 20 feet."
Urinary Sodium,Measures the amount of sodium in urine and can be used to assess sodium balance in the body. Normal levels vary depending on diet and health.
